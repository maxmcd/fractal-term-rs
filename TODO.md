= TODO

add 'clamp' logic for min zoom; also x/y bounds

anim-in of some kind

make max_escape user-changable?

other fractals?

run on windows someday (could be much faster); 
would require rustbox to support it, or find another lib (rogue thing)

also test on linux?
and then test on remote terminal har

= NICE TO

make anim class time-based (how to do this with friction coefficient tho?)
