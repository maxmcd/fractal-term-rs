= TODO

add help show/hide tween

re-add 'clamp' logic
    
re-add logic to stop anim when velocity below a threshhold value

make anim class time-based (how to do this with friction coefficient tho?)
features

auto-contrast using histogram?

and tween 'brightness' for anim-in or for help text etc.

add waypoint action, including for 'reset' 

add other fractals?

run on windows someday (could be much faster); 
would require rustbox to support it, or find another lib
also on linux?
