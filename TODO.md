= TODO

*** make View a trait and 'subclass' it to handle mandelbrot vs julia-specific "coord anim" treatments

default_center isn't being used seems like

make max_escape user-changable?

more julia formulas?

run on windows someday (could be much faster); 
would require rustbox to support it, or find another lib (rogue thing)

also test on linux?
and then test on remote terminal har

= NICE TO

make anim class time-based (how to do this with friction coefficient tho?)
